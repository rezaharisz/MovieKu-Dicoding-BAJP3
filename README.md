MovieKu V3 is a project for my final submission in "Belajar Android Jetpack Pro" course in Dicoding. 
What i use in this project is :

- Room Database
- Paging 2
- Repository
- Live Data
- Idling Resource
- DI Injection
- ViewModel
- Retrofit
- Unit Test
- Instrumental Test

There is some different from MovieKu V2, which is the Carousel RecyclerView, 
i change it to default RecylerView because my CarouselRecyclerView can't be used by Paging 2
